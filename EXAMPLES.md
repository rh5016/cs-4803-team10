## EQ Modifications

### Brightness & Air

| Input | Processing Applied | Change Log |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| "make it brighter" | High shelf boost at 8kHz +2.5dB | High Shelf 8kHz +2.5dB |
| "add more air" | High shelf boost at 10kHz +4.0dB | High Shelf 10kHz +4.0dB |
| "sparkle" | High shelf boost at 12kHz +3.0dB | High Shelf 12kHz +3.0dB |
| "more clarity" | Peak boost at 2.5kHz +2.0dB Q:1.5 | Peak 2.5kHz +2.0dB Q:1.5 |

### Warmth & Body

| Input | Processing Applied | Change Log |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| "warmer" | Peak boost at 800Hz +2.0dB; High shelf cut at 10kHz -1.5dB | Peak 800Hz +2.0dB<br>High Shelf 10kHz -1.5dB |
| "add body" | Peak boost at 300Hz +3.0dB Q:1.5 | Peak 300Hz +3.0dB Q:1.5 |
| "smoother" | High shelf cut at 5kHz -2.0dB | High Shelf 5kHz -2.0dB |

### Bass

| Input | Processing Applied | Change Log |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| "more bass" | Low shelf boost at 100Hz +4.0dB | Low Shelf 100Hz +4.0dB |
| "deeper bass" | Low shelf boost at 60Hz +3.0dB | Low Shelf 60Hz +3.0dB |
| "less boom" | Low shelf cut at 150Hz -3.0dB | Low Shelf 150Hz -3.0dB |

### Presence

| Input | Processing Applied | Change Log |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| "more presence" | Peak boost at 3kHz +3.0dB Q:2.0 | Peak 3kHz +3.0dB Q:2.0 |
| "forward" | Peak boost at 3kHz +3.0dB Q:2.0 | Peak 3kHz +3.0dB Q:2.0 |

## Reverb

| Input | Processing Applied | Change Log |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| "more space" | Room reverb, Wet 15% | Room Reverb: Wet 15%, Room 40%, Damping 30% |
| "add room" | Room reverb, Wet 15% | Room Reverb: Wet 15%, Room 40%, Damping 30% |
| "hall reverb" | Hall reverb, Wet 25% | Hall Reverb: Wet 25%, Room 80%, Damping 50% |
| "ambience" | Ambience reverb, Wet 10% | Ambience: Wet 10%, Room 30%, Damping 40% |

## Compression

| Input | Processing Applied | Change Log |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| "more punch" | Ratio 4:1, Attack 3ms, Release 60ms, +2dB makeup | Compressor: Ratio 4:1, Attack 3ms, Release 60ms, +2dB makeup |
| "glue it" | Ratio 2.5:1, Attack 10ms, Release 100ms | Compressor: Ratio 2.5:1, Attack 10ms, Release 100ms |
| "tighter" | Ratio 2.5:1, Attack 10ms, Release 100ms | Compressor: Ratio 2.5:1, Attack 10ms, Release 100ms |

## Combinations

Try combining keywords for complex effects:

- "bright and airy" - Multiple EQ boosts
- "warm with room" - EQ + Reverb
- "punchy and tight" - Compression + EQ
- "airy with hall" - EQ + Hall reverb

## Intensity Modifiers

The Intensity slider (0-2x) scales all effect parameters:

- **0.5x**: Subtle, gentle changes
- **1.0x**: Standard processing (default)
- **1.5x**: More pronounced effects
- **2.0x**: Maximum intensity

## Tips

1. Be descriptive: "warmer" works better than just "warm"
2. Combine effects naturally: "bright and spacious"
3. Use intensity slider to adjust effect strength
4. Check the changes log to see exactly what was applied
5. Experiment with different keywords to discover new sounds
